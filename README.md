# Stacks-Library

This Library contains Implementation of the data structure stack, using BinaryNode.

This Implementation supports:
     - initializer list based construction.
     - iterator based construction.
     - Finding min and max elements
     - The begin() and end() methods to support const iterators
     - The 'dump' method which allows fitting of one stack over the top of the other.
